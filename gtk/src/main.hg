/** Main application class
 * Every application must have one of these objects.
 * It may not be global and must be the first Gtk object created.
 * It is a singleton so declaring more than one will simply access the first
 * created.
 *
 * Normal use of this class is in the main() function to give argc and argv
 * to the gtk initialization. Widgets can use Gtk::Main::quit()
 * to exit from the application.
 *
 * The internals of the widget have been disguised as signals
 * so that the user can easily connect using the same methods
 * used throughout the widget interface.
 *
 * Minimal gtkmm application is something like this:
 * @code
 * int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
 *     Gtk::Main kit(argc, argv);
 *     ... create some widgets ...
 *     kit.run();
 * }
 * @endcode
