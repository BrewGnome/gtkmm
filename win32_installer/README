To create the installer, first build all libraries with both mingw (with
documentation enabled, you will need doxygen and graphviz for this) and MSVC
(both Debug and Release). 'make install' the mingw-built ones.

Then, run the build-installer script. You might need to adjust some paths
in the install-msvc-module script. I hope to generalize the script to
always find the correct paths in the near future.

The gtk_runtime_setup-2.12.ini and gtk_devel_setup-2.12.ini are not used by
the installer per se, but those are uploaded to
ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/gtkmm/2.12/. The installer
downloads them from there to find out what GTK+ file to load in case GTK+ is
not yet installed.
