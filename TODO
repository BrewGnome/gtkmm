Others:

  - Check that we still need these Adjustment hacks.
  - The existing gtkmm samples are coded bizarrely.
  - gtkmmproc should check whether the first C arg is const, and if it is it should ensure that the C++ method is const.
  - grep for Gdk[Not ::] to check that we use our wrappers in method args.
  - Scan for old-style docs comments and put them in gtk_docs_override.xml if necessary.
  - The following methods should be renamed to be more consistent with
    the rest of the Gtk+/Gtkmm API
      file               class                  current name  new name

  - Pangomm: Add examples and test cases.


DONE:
  - What's an 'action' signal. Are they only for emitting by keybindings? Maybe they shouldn't be wrapped.
    They are signals that can be directly emitted, but that's rare so people can do it via C if they need to.

  - Karl's reusable exception handler idea - to fix the exceptions versus C problem.
    After the discussion about Glib::Error, this seems to be complete. murrayc
  - Widget::show_all_children() would be helpful.
    Done. murrayc.
  - Gtk::TextBuffer::set_text() and friends should probably be overloaded for character sequences, too.
    Done by Daniel Elstner.
  - calls to method(Glib::RefPtr<Object> val) are ambiguous if there is also a method(gint val).
    I might have fixed this - I can't remember. murrayc.
  - get _CHECK macro working properly.
    This seems to have disappeared along with the deprecated widgets. murrayc.
  - Merge C reference docs into C++ code for Doxygen. - needs XML-parsing regex perl code.
  - All objects should have cast constructors automatically. We shouldn't need to use _CAST_CTOR.
    Likewise for _DTOR - Gtk::Widget uses _CUSTOM_DTOR. murrayc.
  - rename ScrolledWindow::add_with_viewport() to ScrolledWindow_add_to_viewport()?
    Reimplemented add() in ScrolledWindow - see ChangeLog. murrayc.
  - Flags: input parameters that are flags should probably not be typed as the flag, because 2 or more ORed flags
    always need a cast. Maybe a guint? E.g. Gtk::Table::attach().
    (fixed with Daniel's enum wrappers.)
  - add interface system
  - Fix all the license headers - they should be copyright FSF, and we should get the papers done.
    gnu.org won't reply to my emails about assigning copyright. Maybe we should give up this idea. murrayc.
