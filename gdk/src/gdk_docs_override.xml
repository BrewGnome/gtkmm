<function name="gtk_window_move">
<description>
Asks the &amp;lt;link linkend=&quot;gtk-X11-arch&quot;&amp;gt;window manager&amp;lt;/link&amp;gt; to move
@window to the given position.  Window managers are free to ignore
this; most window managers ignore requests for initial window
positions (instead using a user-defined placement algorithm) and
honor requests after the window has already been shown.

Note: the position is the position of the gravity-determined
reference point for the window. The gravity determines two things:
first, the location of the reference point in root window
coordinates; and second, which point on the window is positioned at
the reference point.

By default the gravity is #GDK_GRAVITY_NORTH_WEST, so the reference
point is simply the @x, @y supplied to Gtk::Window::move(). The
top-left corner of the window decorations (aka window frame or
border) will be placed at @x, @y.  Therefore, to position a window
at the top left of the screen, you want to use the default gravity
(which is #GDK_GRAVITY_NORTH_WEST) and move the window to 0,0.

To position a window at the bottom right corner of the screen, you
would set #GDK_GRAVITY_SOUTH_EAST, which means that the reference
point is at @x + the window width and @y + the window height, and
the bottom-right corner of the window border will be placed at that
reference point. So, to place a window in the bottom right corner
you would first set gravity to south east, then write:
&amp;lt;literal&amp;gt;Gtk::Window::move (window, Gdk::screen_width () - window_width,
Gdk::screen_height () - window_height)&amp;lt;/literal&amp;gt;.

The extended window manager hints specification at
&amp;lt;ulink url=&quot;http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/wm-spec.html&quot;&amp;gt;
http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/wm-spec.html&amp;lt;/ulink&amp;gt; has a
nice table of gravities in the &quot;implementation notes&quot; section.

The Gtk::Window::get_position() documentation may also be relevant.
