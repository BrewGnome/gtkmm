2003-09-04  Bradley Bell  <btb@debian.org>
 
 	* docs/reference/Makefile.am: Distribute doxygen tags 

2003-08-20  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>
  
 	* gdk/src/display.hg: Add refreturn WRAP_METHOD() parameter to
 	open() and open_default_libgtk_only(), because these seem to return
 	an existing instance rather than a new one. Should fix bug #119049.

2003-08-20  Frank Naumann  <fnaumann@freemint.de>
 
 	* demos/gtk-demo/example_treeview_editable_cells.cc,
  	  examples/book/treeview/editable_cells/examplewindow.cc,
  	  gtk/src/treeview.hg: Added workaround for MSVC++.
  	The MSVC++ now compile Gtk::TreeView::append_column_editable
  	and the result work as expected. An exact description
  	can be found in the treeview.h as comment. Removed
  	the no longer required MSVC++ workarounds from the
  	examples too.

2003-08-11  Martin Schulze  <teebaum@cvs.gnome.org>

	* gtk/src/treeview.hg, docs/tutorial/gtkmm-tut.xml:
	Add information about what to do when the column type is not
	supported and TreeView::append_column() sets up the CellRenderer
	incompletely (bug #118922).

2003-07-21  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>
 
 	* src/gtk/buttonbox.hg: Documentation: Corrected the switched 
 	vertical/horizonal descriptions of VButtonBox and HButtonBox.
 	Bug #117883.

2003-07-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>
 
 	* gtk/src/object.ccg Object::_init_unmanage(): 
 	Don't g_object_ref() objects that are already not managed, such as 
 	stuff used with Glib::Wrap() which is already in a container 
 	(Containers sink (unfloat) child widgets after they are added). Also, 
 	don't mark it as not manage()d, (!referenced_) of course. This was 
 	doing one-too-many refs, so sometimes the objects would not be 
 	finalized even if they were destroyed. Daniel Elstner found this 
 	potential problem months ago and I should have listened to him.
 	This seems to fix the lifetime bug shown in tests/wrap_existing. I think this
   fixes the get_toplevel_windows() leak shown in tests/refcount_dialog also.
   Thanks to Harold Hopfes for doing _lots_ of investigation work on this bug.
 	* gtk/src/window.ccg: Window::_destroy_c_instance():
 	Remove the g_object_unref() that was a window-specific fix for the
 	extra g_object_ref() in gtk/src/object.ccg above.

2003-07-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* pango/src/pango_docs_override.xml,
	  gdk/src/gdk_docs_override.xml,
	  gtk/src/gtk_docs_override.xml: Added overrides for documentation 
	that talks about null pointer values where we use references. Added 
	TODOs in the .hg files to add unset() methods in 2.4 to support this
	functionality.

2003-07-03  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Used %p and (void*) cast to various g_warning()s used when
	--enable-debug-refcounting is used, avoiding compiler warnings.
	* Added tests/wrap_existing, which shows a memory leak that we are
	currently working on.

2003-06-17  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>
 
 	* docs/FAQ/gtkmm_faq.xml: Applied patch from Andreas Rottman 
 	mentioning libsigcx extension library.

2003-06-13  Cedric Gustin  <cedric.gustin@swing.be>
 
         * gtk/src/treeviewcolumn.hg: Added declaration of
 	generate_cellrenderer full class specialization for types bool and
 	Gdk::Pixbuf. This solves a long-standing bug with treeviews on
 	win32. Hopefully, it will also solve bug #113688 on Debian.
 	* demos/gtk-demo/example_stockbrowser.cc: Removed GTKMM_WIN32
 	compiler directive. On win32, stock icons are not displayed as
 	expected in the first column of the treeview.
	
2003-05-31  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* configure.in: Depends on GTK+ 2.3.0 now that GTK+ has branched, with
	GTK+ 2.4 in HEAD.
	* configure.in: gmmproc is now installed in a glibmm-2.3 folder
	rather than a glibmm-2.4 folder.
	* gtk/src/alignment.hg: Wrapped new padding functions and properties. 
	Wrote New in GTK+ 2.4 next to them. They need regenerated .defs files,
	but we can do that later.

2003-05-18  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>
 
 	* docs/tutorial/gtkmm-tut.xml: TreeView chapter: Replaced some TODOs
 	with short paragraphs. Added copies of the example screenshots to
 	show the list and tree models.

2003-05-14  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Applied some of MSVC++ .NET 2003 changes from jburris. For instance,
	use of Gtk:: prefix with manage, because MSVC++ can not guess it. Also
	corrected the out-of-sync protected/private modifiers in the private
	gtype classes and their prototypes.

2003-05-09  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>
 
 	* gtk/src/menushell.[hg|ccg] replace GP_LIST_CONTAINER_REMOVE() with
 	custom-written remove() and erase() MenuList methods, to ensure that
 	we unset the accel widget that we might have set in the MenuItem() 
 	constructor. This avoids a memory leak due to the extra reference.
	* gtk/src/accel_label.[hg|ccg]: Added unset_accel_widget().

2003-05-06  Enrico Costanza  <ec142@york.ac.uk>
 
 	* gtk/src/image.hg: Added "refreturn" to _METHOD_WRAP for get_pixbuf
 	This fixes a bug that caused "(g_object_unref): assertion `G_IS_OBJECT
 	(object)' failed"

2003-05-06  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* gtk/src/optionmenu.[hg|ccg]: Implemented a custom destructor which
	calls remove_menu(), to prevent the menu (set with set_menu()), from
	remembering a dead OptionMenu. See the comment in the destructor for
	more details.
	
2003-05-02  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* *.hg: Added namespace prefix to all StateType parameter types, 
	because there is one in Atk and in Gtk and that confuses Doxygen.
	* demos/gtk-demo/example_change_display.cc: Commented-out some unused
	method parameters, to avoid warnings.

2003-04-26  Gene Ruebsamen <gene@erachampion.com>
	
 	* docs/tutorial/gtkmm-tut.xml: Added a new appendix for win32
 	with the cygwin/command-line portion contributed by Cedric Gustin.
 	Created a new link from the Installation section to point to the new appendix.
 	Also fixed the filename of the tutorial in the "Contributing" section.
 	* docs/tutorial/figures/devcpp_project_options.png: Added new image for the new win32 appendix described above.
	
2003-04-22  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Install headers in x.3 directories instead of .4 because I noticed
	that some are already there so it needed to be fixed, and, given the
	current build files, it was easier to choose .3 than .4 (it is based
	on the library names), and because it does not seem like such a bad
	idea.

2003-04-21  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* gtk/src/menushell.ccg: Added 
	GP_LIST_ITER(Glib::List_Cpp_Iterator<GtkListItem, ComboDropDownItem> 
	because the standard GP_LIST iterator seems to be useless. See bug
	#110206.
	
2003-04-21  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* examples/book/Makefile.am: Added idle directory.
	* configure.in: Added examples/book/idle/Makefile.

2003-03-30  Gene Ruebsamen <gene@erachampion.com>

	* examples/book/timeout/timerexample.[cc,h]: update examples to
	work with Gtkmm2.
	* examples/book/idle/idleexample.[cc,h]: create new idle directory and
	examples for Gtkmm2.
	* docs/tutorial/gtkmm-tut.xml: update the idle/timeout chapter for
	Gtkmm2 and modify to use the program listings in the examples/book/
	directories.
	
2003-04-21 Oli Kessler <ok@tor.ch>
       
         * gtk/gtk_docs_override.xml, fixed docu bug in the function
         gtk_window_set_default
	
2003-04-15  Ole Laursen  <olau@hardworking.dk>

	* gtk/src/widget.{cc,h}g: Added unset_fg/bg/font/text/base to
	support unwrapped null pointer parameter to modify_fg/bg/....

2003-04-13  Ole Laursen  <olau@hardworking.dk>

	* examples/cellrenderercustom/cellrendererpopup.cc: Switched to
	using wrappers of grab_add and friends instead of using the C
	functions.

	* gtk/src/main.ccg, gtk/src/main.hg: Removed commented wrapper of
	grab_add and friends.

	* gtk/src/widget.ccg, gtk/src/widget.hg: Wrapped
	gtk_grab_add()/remove()/get_current().

2003-03-30  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

        * gtk/gtk_docs_override.xml, likewise atk, pango: Added overrides for
 	docs that mention *_free() functions.
	
2003-03-26  Martin Schulze  <MHL.Schulze@t-online.de>

	* pango/src/attrlist.{ccg,hg}: AttrList::insert,
	AttrList::insert_before, AttrList::change must pass a copy of
	the attribute parameter into the c functions (should fix #109334).

2003-03-22  Enrico Scholz  <enrico.scholz@informatik.tu-chemnitz.de>
 
	* examples/Makefile.am_fragment:  Added DESTDIR-support. 

2003-03-20  Ole Laursen  <olau@hardworking.dk>

	* gtk/src/widget.hg: Applied patch from Detlef Reichl to add
	protected set_window and set_allocation (#108484).	

2003-03-18  Cedric Gustin  <cgustin@ibelgique.com>

	* Makefile.am : removed examples from DIST_SUBDIRS.

2003-03-13  Sebastian Rittau  <srittau@jroger.in-berlin.de>

	* gdk/src/gc.hg: Added refreturn flag to both GC::get_screen() flavors.
	Closes bug #108233. (With help by Sven Grottke.)

2003-02-14  Bryan Forbes  <mxpxfifws@yahoo.com>

	* gtk/src/accelgroup.hg:
	* gtk/src/accellabel.hg:
	* gtk/src/adjustment.hg:
	* gtk/src/alignment.hg:
	* gtk/src/arrow.hg:
	* gtk/src/aspectframe.hg:
	* gtk/src/bin.hg: Added documentation for constructors and
	_MEMBER_GET() wrappers.
	* gtk/src/box.hg: Added the PackOptions enum into the gtkmmEnums
	group so it is now on the correct documentation page.
	* gtk/src/enums.hg: Allow Doxygen to grab Gtk::AlignmentEnum (used in
	alignment.hg and others) and added it to the gtkmmEnums group.
	* gtk/src/gtk_docs_override.xml: Added documentation for methods
	in accelgroup.hg, accellabel.hg, adjusment.hg, and arrow.hg.
	
2003-01-27  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>
 
 	* gdk/src/display.hg: Used refreturn on  get_default() and
 	get_core_pointer(), preventing segfaults.
	
2003-01-27  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Replaced use of RefPtr::is_null() with use of operator bool().

2003-01-24  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* gtk/gtkmm/menu_elems.cc: Element::Element(MenuItem): Use the
	Glib::RefPtr<> constructor explicitly, for clarity, and do the
	necessary extra ref - fixes lifetime bug 104194

2003-01-23  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* More TODOs:
	  - Gtk::Container: Removed const set_focus_chain(), added const 
	    get_focus_chain().
          - Gtk::TreeDragSource::drag_data_get() and 
	    Gtk::TreeDragDest::row_drag_possible() now use SelectionData 
	    instead of GtkSelectionData.

2003-01-23  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Updated dnd examples for new signal signatures.

2003-01-23  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* More use of Gdk::Device and Gtk::SelectionData.

2003-01-22  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Used _IGNORE_SIGNAL() on keybinding signals, though gmmproc still
	complains about them. I founds these signals by grepping for
	binding_entry_add_signal in the gtk+ source code.
	* Dealt with various minor TODOs, adding const and using C++ types.

2003-01-22  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Rename GTKMM_ macros to GLIBMM_.

2003-01-22  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* build_shared: Used the general/win32/posix variables used in
	the gtkmm Makefile.ams, so that the libraries actually build.
	* gtk/src/treepath.[hg|ccg]: Removed the TreePath(bool) override, as 
	suggested, because it broke the build, because we don't seem to set 
	gtkmm_COMPILATION.
	* gtk/gtkmm/menu_elem.[h|cc]: It used the RefPtr::operator=() that we
	removed because that operator=() shouldn't be used. Faked the behaviour
	with an explict use of the constructor and a reference() for now, with 
	a TODO.

2003-01-21  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Changed library names: 1.4 -> 1.3 and 2.4 -> 2.3 so that they
	can be unstable.

2003-01-21  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Copied and modified slightly the build_shared files from libgdamm,
	to use the gmmproc from glibmm-2.4.

2003-01-21  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Changed library names: 1.0 -> 1.4 and 2.0 -> 2.4

See gtkmm 2.2 for previous ChangeLog entries.
