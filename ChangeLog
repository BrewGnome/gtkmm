2004-01-14  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* gtk/src/treeiter.[hg}ccg]: Added TreeIter::set_stamp() and 
	get_stamp(), with documentation, for use when implementing a 
	custom TreeModel.
	* gtk/src/treemodel.[hg|ccg]: 
	- Hand-coded several vfuncs and their C callbacks, so that we can have 
	C++ iterators instead of GtkTreeIter*s in the API, and to reorder some 
	parameters.
	- Added 2 extra vfuncs for information about root nodes. The C 
	versions of these vfuncs provide root node information when the iter 
	is NULL, but it is nicer in C++ to just have an extra vfunc without 
	that parameter. This requires an extra if() in the _vfunc_callback() 
	implementation.
	- Added documentation for the vfuncs but gmmproc does not yet put the
	documentation in the right place for the generated vfuncs. 
	* gtk/src/cellrenderer.hg: Added docuemntation for the vfuncs, but
	gmmproc does not put this documentation in the right place yet.
	* examples/: Added treemodelcustom to show a derived TreeModel, which
	overrides those vfuncs, based on the example by Christof Pettig.

2004-01-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* demos/gtk-demo/example_uimanager.cc: Removed extra comma to fix 
	build - patch by Billy O'Connor.

2004-01-09  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* gtk/src/main.[hg|ccg]: Added docs, based on the C docs. Added bool
	return value to iteration().
	* gtk/src/uimanager.hg: Added wrapper for get_toplevels(), as wrapper
	for gtk_ui_manager_get_toplevels().
	* gtk/src/action.hg: add(): Use the new 
	gtk_action_group_add_action_with_accels() instead of
	gtk_action_group_add_action() so that it tries to use the stock 
	accelerator if the action has a stock_id.

2004-01-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* gdk/src/image.hg: Added accessors for public struct fields.

2003-01-05  Eric Bourque <ericb@computer.org>

 	* gtkmm.spec.in: added an unpackaged file (.devhelp) to the %files 
	section. 

2004-01-03  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* gdk/src/*.[hg|ccg]: Added class documentation, by copying it from the
	C documentation.
	* gdk/gdkmm/: Added rgb.[h|cc] with some global functions, wrapping
	gdk_rgb_get_colormap(), gdk_rgb_get_visual() and gdk_rgb_ditherable().
	* gdk/src/color.hg: Documented all methods, apart from the hsv and hsl 
	stuff that is a mystery to me.
	* gdk/src/colormap.hg: Added get_system() as a wrapper for 
	gdk_colormap_get_system().
	* gdk/src/device.hg: Added get_name(), get_source(), get_mode() and
	get_has_cursor() as accessors for read-only struct fields.
	* gdk/src/dragcontext.[hg|ccg]: Added get_targets() and documented it
	and other accessors.
	* gtk/src/liststore.hg, treestore.hg: Documented all methods.
	* gtk/src/tree*.hg: Added lots of class and method documentation.

2003-12-31  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* docs/reference/Makefile.am: Corrected generated .devhelp filename
	so that it matches the pattern that devhelp looks for.
	* docs/reference/doxygen_to_devhelp.xsl: Correct link prefix, so that
	it links to the installed html documentation.
	* gtk/gtkmm/accelmap.[h|cc]: Added lock_path() and unlock_path() as 
	wrappers for new GTK+ functions. Added documentation for all AccelMap
	methods, based on the GTK+ docs.
	* gtk/src/clipboard.[hg|ccg]: Added documentation, based on the C docs.
	Added wait_for_targets(), as a wrapper for 
	gtk_clipboard_wait_for_targets(). Added a version of request_targets()
	with a callback that takes a list of strings, as a wrapper for 
	gtk_clipboard_request_targets(), and deprecated the hacky one
	with a callback that takes a SelectionData.
	* atk/src/: Added Hyperlink, Hypertext, Document, and StreamableContent
	* atk/src/atkobject.hg: Now inherits from the Hypertext interfaces as
	well as the others.
	* gtk/src/gtk_methods.defs: Updated from gtk+ with h2defs.py

2003-12-30  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* docs/reference/Makefile.am: Use installed beautify_docs, instead
	of a copy.
	* configure.in: Use installed glibmm_check_perl() instead of a copy.

2003-12-21  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* gtk/src/menushell.hg: Added cancel() as wrapper for 
	gtk_menu_shell_cancel().

2003-12-20  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* gtk/src/celllayout.hg: Wrapped reorder() method and vfunc.
	* gtk/src/gtk_methods.defs and gdk/src/gdk_methods.defs: regenerated
	with h2defs.pyt.

2003-12-18  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* gdk/src/display.hg: Added set_double_click_distance() as wrapper
	for gdk_display_set_double_click_distance(), though the .defs for
	it are not there yet.
	* gtk/src/settings.hg: Added double-click-distance property.
	* gtk/src/button.hg: Added get/set_alignment() as wrapper for
	gtk_button_get/set_alignment(), though the .defs are not there yet.
	* pango/src/pangoline.hg: Added get_length(), get_start_index(), and
	get_layout() as accessors for the public struct fields.
	* gtk/src/cellrenderertext.hg: Wrapped the new single-paragraph-mode
	property.

2003-12-13  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* docs/reference/Makefile.am: Make sure that gtkmm2.devhelp is
	generated before trying to install it. Added a doxygen-warnings
	target that outputs the doxygen log to doyxgen_warnings.txt.
	* gdk/src/window.hg: Added get_group(), as a wrapper for 
	gdk_window_get_group(), and set_accept_focus() as wrapper for
	gdk_window_set_accept_focus().
	* gdk/src/display.hg: Added get_default_group(), as wrapper for 
	gdk_display_get_default_group().

2.3.1:

2003-12-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>
	
	* gtk/src/gtk_methods.defs: Regenerated with h2defs.py.
	* gtk/src/combobox.hg: Corrected C function name in _WRAP_CONSTRUCT,
	so that the constructor is actually generated.
	* gtk/src/comboboxentry.hg: Added set_text_column() as wrapper
	for gtk_combo_box_entry_set_text_column().
	* gtk/src/entrycompletion.[hg|ccg]: Wrapped match_selected signal,
	unpleasantly, by hand-coding everything.
	* gtk/src/filefilter.[hg|ccg]: Added add_custom() as wrapper for
	gtk_file_filter_add_custom(), using a SignalProxy.
	* gtk/src/menu: Added set_monitor() as wrapper for 
	gtk_menu_set_monitor().
	* gtk/src/treeviewcolumn.hg: Added get_cell_position() as a 
	wrapper for gtk_tree_view_column_cell_get_position().

2003-12-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* atk/atkmm/, pango/pangomm: Added init.[h|cc] so you can use
	these libraries without using all of gtkmm.

2003-12-06  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* gtk/src/radiotoolbutton.[hg|ccg]: Removed the constructor that
	takes a RadioToolButton& group, because it looks like a copy
	constructor. Added a constructor that takes a Widget& icon_group,
	for consistency with the other ToolButton classes.
	Bug 128484 (Billy O'Connor).

2003-12-03  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* gtk/src/widget.hg: Wrapped get_accessible, screen_changed, and 
	can_activate_accel signals, though the .defs are not there for them 
	yet.

2003-11-27  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* gtk/src/treemodel.hg: Added iter_is_valid(). Use the old TreeIter::
	operator bool() as a default implementation, but this is already 
	reimplemented in ListStore and TreeStore, using GTK+ functions.
	* gtk/src/treeiter.hg: operator bool(): Use iter_is_valid() instead
	of our hack.

2003-11-23  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* gtk/src/radiotoolbutton.[hg|ccg]: Manually-implement constructors,
	because the group is not a property.
	* examples/book/toolbar: Use the new Toolbar API, to test it, though
	this example should probably use the UIManager in future.
	* gtk/gtkmm.h: Added the toolitem headers.

2003-11-22  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* gtk/src/toolbar.[hg|ccg]: Deprecated ToolList.
	* examples/Makefile.am_fragment: Added GTKMM_DISABLE_DEPRECATED to
	examples build.
	* gdk/src/pixbuf.[hg|ccg]: Wrapped get_formats().

2003-11-19  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* docs/reference/Makefile.am: Fix the distcheck for the .devhelp file.
	* gtk/src/expander.hg: Add the get/set_markup methods, though there
	are no .defs for them yet.

2003-11-17  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* gtk/src/combobox.hg: Changed constructors, and added set_model(),
	because the model is now a non-construct-only property in GTK+.
	* gtk/gtkmm/comboboxtext.[h|cc]: Used changed API to implement this.
	examples/book/combobox/text now works.

2003-11-16  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* gtk/src/toolbar.[hg|cc]: Wrapped new functions, including the 
	ToolItem-based insert, append, and prepend, and deprecated our
	equivalents of the deprecated C functions.
	Moved deprecated Elements API into toolbar_elements.[h|cc].
	* gtk/src/gtk_docs.xml: Replaced with freshly generated output
	from docextract_to_xml.py from pygtk.
	* Added gdk/src/pixbufformat.[hg|ccg] as wrapper for GdkPixbufFormat.

2003-11-14  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>
 
 	* gdk/src/gdk_docs_override.xml, gtk/src/gtk_docs_override.xm,
 	pango/src/pango_docs_override.xml. Added overrides for 4 or 5 methods
 	that mention Glib::Free, though I feel sure that I did this once
 	before. Bug #126870.

2003-11-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* gtk/src/widget.hg, gdk/src/window.hg: Fixed typos to fix build.

2003-11-03  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* gtk/src/action.[hg|ccg]: Renamed add_action() to add(), to reduce
	the amount of client code slightly.
	* gtk/src/celllayout.[hg|ccg]: Added set_cell_data_func(), using
	SignalProxy.
	* gtk/src/treemodelfilter.[hg|ccg]: 
	Added set_visible_func(), using SignalProxy.
	Added convert methods.


2003-11-02  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* gtk/src/*action.[hg|ccg]: renamed create_from_stock() to
	create() because I think we can overload the methods, because the
	parameters are distinguishable.
	* examples/book/dialogs/: Added filechooserdialog, by copying and
	modifying the fileselectiondialog example.
	* gtk/src/entrycompletion.[hg|ccg]: wrap set_match_func() using
	SignalProxy.

2003-11-01  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* gtk/src/: Added wrappers for FileChooser, FileChooserWidget,
	FileChooserDialog and FileFilter. FileChooser is an interface
	but I see no way to override it.
	* Wrapped some more signals and vfuncs.

2003-10-31  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* docs/index.html: Corrected links to glibmm docs, using relative 
	links.

2003-10-30  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* gtk/src/toolitem.hg: Removed get/set_pack_end() now that they are
	removed from GTK+, to fix the CVS build.
	* docs/Makefile.am_fragment: Install docs to gtkmm-2.4 directory
	instead of gtkmm-2.3.
	* docs/reference/Makefile.am: Add installdox rule to make the 
	reference html link to the glibmm docs when they are installed.

2003-10-26  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Dealt with several //TODO comments, adding several unset_*() methods
	* *Action: Changed create() to create_from_stock() and create.
	* ToggleAction: create() methods: Added bool is_active parameter.
	* RadioAction: create() methods: Added group parameter.
	* Added gtk/gtkmm/radiobuttongroup.[h|cc] containing 
	Gtk::RadioButtonGroup. This was previously in the Gtk::Menu_Helpers
	namespace. It now works with RadioActions as well as the 3 other
	Radio item classes.
	* Added examples/combobox/complex, showing a custom tree model,

2.3.0:

2003-10-24  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* gtk/src/gtk_signals.defs: regenerated, keeping hand-coded changes,
	after adding some extra GTypes to tools/extra_defs_gen.
	* gkt/gtkmm: Added cellrenderer_generation.[h|cc], with some of the 
	templates and template specialisations previously in 
	treeviewcolumn.[hg|ccg]. This allowed them to be reused in
	gtk/src/celllayout.hg for a pack_start(model column) template.
	* demos/gtk-demo/: Added example_ui_manager.cc - a C++ version of
	the C one.  

2003-10-22  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Added wrappers for GtkToolItem, ToolButton, ToggleButton,
	RadioToolButton.

2003-10-17  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* gtk/src/combobox.hg: Updated for latest API.
	* Added gtk/gtkmm/comboboxtext.[h|cc], putting text-based stuff
	in a sub class.
	* gtk/src/treemodel.[hg|ccg]: Added const overload of children(),
	but it's a bad hack that needs more attention.
	* Added examples/book/combobox, which uses ComboBoxText and should use
	ComboBox also in future. It segfaults at the moment.
	* Added gtk/src/toggleaction.[hg|ccg] and gtk/src/radioaction.hg.
	* Wrapped GList* and GSList*-using methods.
	* UIManager: Wrapped Error-using methods, with optional errthrow
	  parameter of _WRAP_METHOD().
	* gtk/src/gtk_signals.defs: Updated with newly-generated defs from
	extra_defs_gen, redoing the by-hand corrections.
	* examples/book/dialogs/colorselection, fontselection: Used
	the buttons instead. This will be moved into the buttons folder
	later.
	* examples/book/dialogs/messagedialog: Updated for new constructor
	API.

2003-10-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* gtk/src/treemodel.hg: Comment-out wrapper for row-inserted
	signal, until gtk+ bug 123923 has been dealt with, to prevent
	treeview crash with GTK+ 2.3

2003-10-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Added wrappers for new GTK+  classes: Action, ActionGroup, 
        CellLayout, ComboBox, ComboBoxEntry, ColorButton, EntryCompletion,
        Expander, FontButton, UIManager, and a few extra methods and
        properties. More API details in NEWS.

2003-10-01  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* tools/m4/convert_gdk.m4: Correct the GdkDrawable conversion to
	fix the build.

2003-09-30  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* gtk/src/cellrenderer.hg, gtk/src/gtk_vfuncs.defs, 
	tools/m4/convert_gdk.m4: The CellRenderer render vfunc now takes a 
	Gdk::Drawable instead of a Gdk::Window, as per my recent change 
	in GTK+ in CVS. See bug #102405.

2003-09-30  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* gtk/src/gtk_methods.defs: Updated with h2defs.py from GTK+ in cvs.

2003-09-30  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* gtk/src/cellrenderer.hg, gtk/src/gtk_signals.defs:
	Wrapped the CellRenderer::background-cell-* properties that seem
	to have been added in GTK+ 2.2, but that we had not wrapped yet.
	Bug #116803.

2003-09-30  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* gtk/src/textbuffer.hg: get_selection_bounds() returns a bool
	to say whether anything is selected. Bug #118459
	* gtk/src/widget.hg: get_style_property(): Parameter renamed to
	avoid rare warning. Part of bug #117740.

2003-09-28  Bradley Bell  <btb@debian.org>
 
 	* gtk/src/notebook.hg, gtk/src/treeiter.ccg, gtk/src/treeiter.hg:
 	workarounds for inaccessible base bugs with latest gcc.

2003-09-11  Cedric Gustin  <cedric.gustin@swing.be>

	* atk/src/text.hg, gdk/src/display.hg, gdk/src/displaymanager.hg,
	gdk/src/screen.hg, glib/glibmm/threadpool.cc,
	gtk/src/clipboard.hg, gtk/src/treerowreference.hg,
	gtk/src/widget.hg, gtk/src/window.hg : Removed a bunch of
	_GTKMMPROC_SIGNAL_H_AND_CC(#ifndef G_OS_WIN32) restrictions. These
	functions are now implemented in the latest (2.2.4) GTK+ on win32.
	* gdk/src/Makefile_list_of_hg.am_fragment,
	gtk/src/Makefile_list_of_hg.am_fragment : Adapted Makefile.am's
	accordingly. In particular, Gtk::Clipboard is now supported on
	win32.
	* README.win32 : Updated list of unsupported functions. 

2003-09-04  Bradley Bell  <btb@debian.org>
 
 	* docs/reference/Makefile.am: Distribute doxygen tags 

2003-08-20  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>
  
 	* gdk/src/display.hg: Add refreturn WRAP_METHOD() parameter to
 	open() and open_default_libgtk_only(), because these seem to return
 	an existing instance rather than a new one. Should fix bug #119049.

2003-08-20  Frank Naumann  <fnaumann@freemint.de>
 
 	* demos/gtk-demo/example_treeview_editable_cells.cc,
  	  examples/book/treeview/editable_cells/examplewindow.cc,
  	  gtk/src/treeview.hg: Added workaround for MSVC++.
  	The MSVC++ now compile Gtk::TreeView::append_column_editable
  	and the result work as expected. An exact description
  	can be found in the treeview.h as comment. Removed
  	the no longer required MSVC++ workarounds from the
  	examples too.

2003-08-11  Martin Schulze  <teebaum@cvs.gnome.org>

	* gtk/src/treeview.hg, docs/tutorial/gtkmm-tut.xml:
	Add information about what to do when the column type is not
	supported and TreeView::append_column() sets up the CellRenderer
	incompletely (bug #118922).

2003-07-21  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>
 
 	* src/gtk/buttonbox.hg: Documentation: Corrected the switched 
 	vertical/horizonal descriptions of VButtonBox and HButtonBox.
 	Bug #117883.

2003-07-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>
 
 	* gtk/src/object.ccg Object::_init_unmanage(): 
 	Don't g_object_ref() objects that are already not managed, such as 
 	stuff used with Glib::Wrap() which is already in a container 
 	(Containers sink (unfloat) child widgets after they are added). Also, 
 	don't mark it as not manage()d, (!referenced_) of course. This was 
 	doing one-too-many refs, so sometimes the objects would not be 
 	finalized even if they were destroyed. Daniel Elstner found this 
 	potential problem months ago and I should have listened to him.
 	This seems to fix the lifetime bug shown in tests/wrap_existing. I think this
   fixes the get_toplevel_windows() leak shown in tests/refcount_dialog also.
   Thanks to Harold Hopfes for doing _lots_ of investigation work on this bug.
 	* gtk/src/window.ccg: Window::_destroy_c_instance():
 	Remove the g_object_unref() that was a window-specific fix for the
 	extra g_object_ref() in gtk/src/object.ccg above.

2003-07-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* pango/src/pango_docs_override.xml,
	  gdk/src/gdk_docs_override.xml,
	  gtk/src/gtk_docs_override.xml: Added overrides for documentation 
	that talks about null pointer values where we use references. Added 
	TODOs in the .hg files to add unset() methods in 2.4 to support this
	functionality.

2003-07-03  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Used %p and (void*) cast to various g_warning()s used when
	--enable-debug-refcounting is used, avoiding compiler warnings.
	* Added tests/wrap_existing, which shows a memory leak that we are
	currently working on.

2003-06-17  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>
 
 	* docs/FAQ/gtkmm_faq.xml: Applied patch from Andreas Rottman 
 	mentioning libsigcx extension library.

2003-06-13  Cedric Gustin  <cedric.gustin@swing.be>
 
         * gtk/src/treeviewcolumn.hg: Added declaration of
 	generate_cellrenderer full class specialization for types bool and
 	Gdk::Pixbuf. This solves a long-standing bug with treeviews on
 	win32. Hopefully, it will also solve bug #113688 on Debian.
 	* demos/gtk-demo/example_stockbrowser.cc: Removed GTKMM_WIN32
 	compiler directive. On win32, stock icons are not displayed as
 	expected in the first column of the treeview.
	
2003-05-31  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* configure.in: Depends on GTK+ 2.3.0 now that GTK+ has branched, with
	GTK+ 2.4 in HEAD.
	* configure.in: gmmproc is now installed in a glibmm-2.3 folder
	rather than a glibmm-2.4 folder.
	* gtk/src/alignment.hg: Wrapped new padding functions and properties. 
	Wrote New in GTK+ 2.4 next to them. They need regenerated .defs files,
	but we can do that later.

2003-05-18  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>
 
 	* docs/tutorial/gtkmm-tut.xml: TreeView chapter: Replaced some TODOs
 	with short paragraphs. Added copies of the example screenshots to
 	show the list and tree models.

2003-05-14  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Applied some of MSVC++ .NET 2003 changes from jburris. For instance,
	use of Gtk:: prefix with manage, because MSVC++ can not guess it. Also
	corrected the out-of-sync protected/private modifiers in the private
	gtype classes and their prototypes.

2003-05-09  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>
 
 	* gtk/src/menushell.[hg|ccg] replace GP_LIST_CONTAINER_REMOVE() with
 	custom-written remove() and erase() MenuList methods, to ensure that
 	we unset the accel widget that we might have set in the MenuItem() 
 	constructor. This avoids a memory leak due to the extra reference.
	* gtk/src/accel_label.[hg|ccg]: Added unset_accel_widget().

2003-05-06  Enrico Costanza  <ec142@york.ac.uk>
 
 	* gtk/src/image.hg: Added "refreturn" to _METHOD_WRAP for get_pixbuf
 	This fixes a bug that caused "(g_object_unref): assertion `G_IS_OBJECT
 	(object)' failed"

2003-05-06  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* gtk/src/optionmenu.[hg|ccg]: Implemented a custom destructor which
	calls remove_menu(), to prevent the menu (set with set_menu()), from
	remembering a dead OptionMenu. See the comment in the destructor for
	more details.
	
2003-05-02  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* *.hg: Added namespace prefix to all StateType parameter types, 
	because there is one in Atk and in Gtk and that confuses Doxygen.
	* demos/gtk-demo/example_change_display.cc: Commented-out some unused
	method parameters, to avoid warnings.

2003-04-26  Gene Ruebsamen <gene@erachampion.com>
	
 	* docs/tutorial/gtkmm-tut.xml: Added a new appendix for win32
 	with the cygwin/command-line portion contributed by Cedric Gustin.
 	Created a new link from the Installation section to point to the new appendix.
 	Also fixed the filename of the tutorial in the "Contributing" section.
 	* docs/tutorial/figures/devcpp_project_options.png: Added new image for the new win32 appendix described above.
	
2003-04-22  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Install headers in x.3 directories instead of .4 because I noticed
	that some are already there so it needed to be fixed, and, given the
	current build files, it was easier to choose .3 than .4 (it is based
	on the library names), and because it does not seem like such a bad
	idea.

2003-04-21  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* gtk/src/menushell.ccg: Added 
	GP_LIST_ITER(Glib::List_Cpp_Iterator<GtkListItem, ComboDropDownItem> 
	because the standard GP_LIST iterator seems to be useless. See bug
	#110206.
	
2003-04-21  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* examples/book/Makefile.am: Added idle directory.

2003-04-21 Oli Kessler <ok@tor.ch>
       
         * gtk/gtk_docs_override.xml, fixed docu bug in the function
         gtk_window_set_default
	
2003-04-15  Ole Laursen  <olau@hardworking.dk>

	* gtk/src/widget.{cc,h}g: Added unset_fg/bg/font/text/base to
	support unwrapped null pointer parameter to modify_fg/bg/....

2003-04-13  Ole Laursen  <olau@hardworking.dk>

	* examples/cellrenderercustom/cellrendererpopup.cc: Switched to
	using wrappers of grab_add and friends instead of using the C
	functions.

	* gtk/src/main.ccg, gtk/src/main.hg: Removed commented wrapper of
	grab_add and friends.

	* gtk/src/widget.ccg, gtk/src/widget.hg: Wrapped
	gtk_grab_add()/remove()/get_current().

2003-03-30  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

        * gtk/gtk_docs_override.xml, likewise atk, pango: Added overrides for
 	docs that mention *_free() functions.
	
2003-03-26  Martin Schulze  <MHL.Schulze@t-online.de>

	* pango/src/attrlist.{ccg,hg}: AttrList::insert,
	AttrList::insert_before, AttrList::change must pass a copy of
	the attribute parameter into the c functions (should fix #109334).

2003-03-22  Enrico Scholz  <enrico.scholz@informatik.tu-chemnitz.de>
 
	* examples/Makefile.am_fragment:  Added DESTDIR-support. 

2003-03-20  Ole Laursen  <olau@hardworking.dk>

	* gtk/src/widget.hg: Applied patch from Detlef Reichl to add
	protected set_window and set_allocation (#108484).	

2003-03-18  Cedric Gustin  <cgustin@ibelgique.com>

	* Makefile.am : removed examples from DIST_SUBDIRS.

2003-03-13  Sebastian Rittau  <srittau@jroger.in-berlin.de>

	* gdk/src/gc.hg: Added refreturn flag to both GC::get_screen() flavors.
	Closes bug #108233. (With help by Sven Grottke.)

2003-02-14  Bryan Forbes  <mxpxfifws@yahoo.com>

	* gtk/src/accelgroup.hg:
	* gtk/src/accellabel.hg:
	* gtk/src/adjustment.hg:
	* gtk/src/alignment.hg:
	* gtk/src/arrow.hg:
	* gtk/src/aspectframe.hg:
	* gtk/src/bin.hg: Added documentation for constructors and
	_MEMBER_GET() wrappers.
	* gtk/src/box.hg: Added the PackOptions enum into the gtkmmEnums
	group so it is now on the correct documentation page.
	* gtk/src/enums.hg: Allow Doxygen to grab Gtk::AlignmentEnum (used in
	alignment.hg and others) and added it to the gtkmmEnums group.
	* gtk/src/gtk_docs_override.xml: Added documentation for methods
	in accelgroup.hg, accellabel.hg, adjusment.hg, and arrow.hg.
	
2003-01-27  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>
 
 	* gdk/src/display.hg: Used refreturn on  get_default() and
 	get_core_pointer(), preventing segfaults.
	
2003-01-27  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Replaced use of RefPtr::is_null() with use of operator bool().

2003-01-24  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* gtk/gtkmm/menu_elems.cc: Element::Element(MenuItem): Use the
	Glib::RefPtr<> constructor explicitly, for clarity, and do the
	necessary extra ref - fixes lifetime bug 104194

2003-01-23  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* More TODOs:
	  - Gtk::Container: Removed const set_focus_chain(), added const 
	    get_focus_chain().
          - Gtk::TreeDragSource::drag_data_get() and 
	    Gtk::TreeDragDest::row_drag_possible() now use SelectionData 
	    instead of GtkSelectionData.

2003-01-23  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Updated dnd examples for new signal signatures.

2003-01-23  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* More use of Gdk::Device and Gtk::SelectionData.

2003-01-22  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Used _IGNORE_SIGNAL() on keybinding signals, though gmmproc still
	complains about them. I founds these signals by grepping for
	binding_entry_add_signal in the gtk+ source code.
	* Dealt with various minor TODOs, adding const and using C++ types.

2003-01-22  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Rename GTKMM_ macros to GLIBMM_.

2003-01-22  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* build_shared: Used the general/win32/posix variables used in
	the gtkmm Makefile.ams, so that the libraries actually build.
	* gtk/src/treepath.[hg|ccg]: Removed the TreePath(bool) override, as 
	suggested, because it broke the build, because we don't seem to set 
	gtkmm_COMPILATION.
	* gtk/gtkmm/menu_elem.[h|cc]: It used the RefPtr::operator=() that we
	removed because that operator=() shouldn't be used. Faked the behaviour
	with an explict use of the constructor and a reference() for now, with 
	a TODO.

2003-01-21  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Changed library names: 1.4 -> 1.3 and 2.4 -> 2.3 so that they
	can be unstable.

2003-01-21  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Copied and modified slightly the build_shared files from libgdamm,
	to use the gmmproc from glibmm-2.4.

2003-01-21  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Changed library names: 1.0 -> 1.4 and 2.0 -> 2.4

See gtkmm 2.2 for previous ChangeLog entries.
