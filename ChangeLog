	* build_shared: Used the general/win32/posix variables used in
	the gtkmm Makefile.ams, so that the libraries actually build.
	* gtk/src/treepath.[hg|ccg]: Removed the TreePath(bool) override, as 
	suggested, because it broke the build, because we don't seem to set 
	gtkmm_COMPILATION.
	* gtk/gtkmm/menu_elem.[h|cc]: It used the RefPtr::operator=() that we
	removed because that operator=() shouldn't be used. Faked the behaviour
	with an explict use of the constructor and a reference() for now, with 
	a TODO.

	* Changed library names: 1.4 -> 1.3 and 2.4 -> 2.3 so that they
	can be unstable.

	* Copied and modified slightly the build_shared files from libgdamm,
	to use the gmmproc from glibmm-2.4.
